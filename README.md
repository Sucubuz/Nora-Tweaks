# Nora Tweaks

Nora Tweaks is a custom addon for the [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/) that introduces quality-of-life features. This addon was developed for my personal use.

## Features

*   **Custom Category Manager:** Create, manage, and sort your own custom module categories, which appear seamlessly in the module list.
*   **Auto DirtPath:** Automatically creates paths from dirt-like blocks when holding a shovel.
